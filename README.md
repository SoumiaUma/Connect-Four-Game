# Connect Four Game

This is a Connect Four game with game pieces 'X' and 'O'. The helperFunctions.cpp was used to write the functions used in the main file (connectFour.cpp). The header file was used to call the functions from helperFunctions.cpp into connectFour.cpp

This is a sample picture of the game with player 2 ('O') winning a diagonal win:
